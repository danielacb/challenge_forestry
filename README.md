## Welcome to the Landing Page of a Norwegian Forestry Website!
Greetings! You've landed on the homepage of a forestry website originating from Norway. This creation was an endeavor during a hiring process, although I'm yet to receive feedback from them. Nonetheless, it proudly holds a spot in my portfolio. Who knows, this very project might be the factor that convinces you to consider me for your team?

I crafted this platform using React, Vite, SASS, and i18next, showcasing my proficiency in these technologies.

One of the standout features is its trilingual capacity, offering content in English (en-US), Norwegian Bokm√•l (nb-NO), and Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR). The language presented to you is dynamically determined by your location. However, you can easily manipulate the language selection using the Dev tools, choosing from en-US, nb-NO, or pt-BR as you please.

For additional details or inquiries, I encourage you to reach out to me at contato@danielacb.com.

Thank you for visiting!
